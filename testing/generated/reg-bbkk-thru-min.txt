You could have tried to WRITE/RIGHT RAVE to flatter me.
You could have noted a pattern with the regions in the status line and tried EYEING EASE.
You could have been a bright knave and said R 3 once you'd paired two groups of friends, whether you knew their names or not.
You didn't guess the the bold bowl, the sold soul and the cold coal before finding them.
You could have told a NUDE NAPPER to be more modest in the Crude Crapper.
You could've said FLOUT FLUFF in Out, Uff!.
You could've said FLAK FLIGHT in Sack Site.
You could've said GRANDER GROVE in Dander, Dove.
You didn't uncover the RHYME ROAD in Passed Port.
You didn't take a moment to remember PAUL PANKS in Tall Tank(s).
You didn't find the PLEAD PLAQUE in Treed Track.
You could have tried to JACK GIST for a shorter command to read the track tryst lack list.
