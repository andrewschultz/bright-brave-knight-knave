Almost! That sounds a bit off, though. Pacing in a circle wouldn't get you many places. Something very, very similar might.

Hmm. Sounds a bit off. Math and mathematical reasoning are useful, but not for how badly you can thwack someone. But you could use some math, here. How much, is the question.

You express shock and things that went unexpectedly wrong. Which is close to shock at things going right. But not quite there, yet.

That feels right, but nobody's going to send or sell you the what's in the vent. You must sense another indirect way to find it.

Mimes annoy you, but that's a bit much. Perhaps you could find ironic distance from this for a bonus point, though.
