>kite cave
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-kite-cave-rule-default
You look around, and what do you know? You see part of a kite stuck under a rock, in a cave. You try to move the rock, and when you do, you hear a rumbling. You try to take the kite, but it's tied to a string and is sucked down the hole and around a corner. The hole itself collapses, becoming big enough to climb down.
The cave collapses. There's a passage down, but next to it is a hold-hole. Perhaps looking at it will give you some clues what to do with your journey.

Yes. The bold bowl must be one of the three entities that fit in the hold hole. This is good to know.

#testcase-run-vr-mass-math-rule-default
You sit back and do some calculations as to where the paths must lead. You work out that many must be equivalent, and there cannot be too many. They weave about for a bit, yes, but you have figured a way not to get lost in them.
You hone your theorems and heuristics so well, you realize there is pretty much just one path west, one east, and one north.

#testcase-run-vr-nude-napper-rule-default
You're liberal and lenient and all that, but some things cross the line. It's something you didn't want to see, and something that's awkward to deal with, but you find the offender and suggest they move on. If they aren't physically hurting anyone, they are, and will be, in others' personal space. There's no need for lectures. You nod your head pointedly. They understand, or seem to. Perhaps they will just move on elsewhere, but maybe if enough people speak up, they'll get the big message.

You feel good about doing more than the bare minimum to repel your fears. It's something you always feared, because what if you do more than the bare minimum, and your fears catch up to you anyway? That'd be depressing. Maybe it will happen. But since you've beaten your fears back a bit further, it will take longer than if you do more than the bare minimum, feel fear, and feel silly for not doing more to repel fears in the future. So that's something.

Well, that got rid of some of the irony of "trite."
Tully shakes their head a bit. You've seen into them, but you feel like you can do more.

Yes, indeed, it isn't just about being trite or having irony.
Trite Tully looks shocked! "No! No! It can't be!" Suddenly, they look much more humble.
"Once ... once, they called me a name. Sham, shy! I feel that way again... it's not fair. I deserved so much more! And I had it!"
You wonder what to do. Tully looks pleadingly at you, but you still detect contempt. You think.

You dither between showing too much mercy and too little. Then you think. Tully's had their fun. You wonder if you can just dismiss people like that. Are you really that unsocial? Or antisocial?
Of course not. You've brought three pairs of friends together. And at the end, you brought relief to three people Tully insulted. They've caused enough annoyance. It's time for them to go.
