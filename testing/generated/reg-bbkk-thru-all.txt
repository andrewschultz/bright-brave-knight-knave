`White Wave

>take learner
Taken.

>au 2

>kite cave
by one point

>x hold hole

>x list

>bold bowl
Yes. The bold bowl must be one of the three entities that fit in the hold hole. This is good to know.
[NOTE: you've figured one-third of the sacred items of your quest. You can guess them all for a bonus point, or you can get on with it. Knowing what you look for is not critical to finding it.]
[NOTE: to switch on the option that shows how many similar rhyme pairs you have left in this area, you can type GO GUESS. To see more detailed guess information with THINK, type MO MESS. To be told if you have one word of a good non-point-scoring good guess, YO YES. These all also incorporate the LO LESS option, where the leet learner tells you how many rhymes are left to solve. NO NESS turns everything.]

by one point

#testcase-run-vr-what-whoah-rule-default
It sounds artificial at first to pretend you saw something. Then you think, if I did see something useful, what sort of thing would I see? And somehow, it works! You find a path west through Rut Row.

>mood mapper

#testcase-check-vc-mood-mapper-rule-fallthrough
You don't really want to go looking around here too much, but knowing what might be here, you figure having that focus will help you do so. And what do you know? A mood mapper turns up!
