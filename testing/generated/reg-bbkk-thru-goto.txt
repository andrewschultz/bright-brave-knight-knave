You're kind of confused about directions, here. You maybe need to find some way to see where life might be.

>x hold hole

>x list

>jack gist
WRONG

>bold bowl
Yes. The bold bowl must be one of the three entities that fit in the hold hole. This is good to know.
[NOTE: you've figured one-third of the sacred items of your quest. You can guess them all for a bonus point, or you can get on with it. Knowing what you look for is not critical to finding it.]
[NOTE: to switch on the option that shows how many similar rhyme pairs you have left in this area, you can type GO GUESS. To see more detailed guess information with THINK, type MO MESS. To be told if you have one word of a good non-point-scoring good guess, YO YES. These all also incorporate the LO LESS option, where the leet learner tells you how many rhymes are left to solve. NO NESS turns everything.]
