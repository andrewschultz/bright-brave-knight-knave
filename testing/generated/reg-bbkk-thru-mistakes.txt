#testcase-mistakes-table-of-general-good-guesses-flight-flav-flave
>flight flave
You try a bit of trickery. Can you fly? No, you cannot. You can play small mind games, but you can't violate the laws of physics.
[NOTE: to switch on the option that shows how many similar rhyme pairs you have left in this area, you can type GO GUESS. To see more detailed guess information with THINK, type MO MESS. To be told if you have one word of a good non-point-scoring good guess, YO YES. These all also incorporate the LO LESS option, where the leet learner tells you how many rhymes are left to solve. NO NESS turns everything.]
