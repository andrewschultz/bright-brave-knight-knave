NOTE: this command will be useful later, but you aren't ready to use it, yet. You can track commands like this by typing THINK, which will also clue you if they now work.

>think
You think about more specific challenges you've encountered and not solved, and what you've done and tried, and what you can do.
You can use MASS MATH once you have something to calculate.
