>kite cave
by one point

#testcase-check-vc-kite-cave-rule-fallthrough
You look around, and what do you know? You see part of a kite stuck under a rock, in a cave. You try to move the rock, and when you do, you hear a rumbling. You try to take the kite, but it's tied to a string and is sucked down the hole and around a corner. The hole itself collapses, becoming big enough to climb down.
The cave collapses. There's a passage down, but next to it is a hold-hole. Perhaps looking at it will give you some clues what to do with your journey.

Yes. The bold bowl must be one of the three entities that fit in the hold hole. This is good to know.
[NOTE: you've figured one-third of the sacred items of your quest. You can guess them all for a bonus point, or you can get on with it. Knowing what you look for is not critical to finding it.]
[NOTE: to switch on the option that shows how many similar rhyme pairs you have left in this area, you can type GO GUESS. To see more detailed guess information with THINK, type MO MESS. To be told if you have one word of a good non-point-scoring good guess, YO YES. These all also incorporate the LO LESS option, where the leet learner tells you how many rhymes are left to solve. NO NESS turns everything.]
