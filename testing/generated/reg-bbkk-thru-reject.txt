#testcase-check-vc-kite-cave-rule-fallthrough
You look around, and what do you know? You see part of a kite stuck under a rock, in a cave. You try to move the rock, and when you do, you hear a rumbling. You try to take the kite, but it's tied to a string and is sucked down the hole and around a corner. The hole itself collapses, becoming big enough to climb down.
The cave collapses. There's a passage DOWN, but next to it is a hold-hole. Perhaps looking at it will give you some clues what to do with your journey.

You sit back and do some brute-force calculations as to where the paths must lead. Then you use some intuition you didn't know you had (your mojo must be returning!) You work out that many must be equivalent, and there cannot be too many. They weave about for a bit, yes, but you have figured a way not to get lost in them.

It's something you didn't want to see, and something that's awkward to deal with, but you find the offender and suggest they move on. If they aren't physically hurting anyone, they are, and will be, in others' personal space. There's no need for lectures. You nod your head pointedly. They understand, or seem to. Perhaps they will just move on elsewhere, but maybe if enough people speak up, they'll get the big message.
