#--strict-file: this says that the project requires strict section marking e.g. @all instead of ==t1.

}$REJECT=I couldn't parse that command. You don't need any more than two words long.
}$REJECT1=Most special commands are more than one word. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT1A=Most special commands are more than one word, because of the rhyme-pairs involved. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Bright Brave Knight Knave has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$GREENBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$GREENCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green--one of the words you thought must be right.
}$GREENCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green.
}$YELLOWBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$YELLOWCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow--one of the words must work for a future solution.
}$YELLOWCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow.
}$GONG1=A guide gong rings to notify you that you don't need to go back through
}$GONG=That guide gong, again, rings to notify you that you don't need to go back through

You're kind of confused about directions, here. You maybe need to find some way to see where life might be.

@rej
#testcase-check-vc-fight-fave-rule-if-hold-hole-is-off-stage
>fight fave
Perhaps in the far future. But right now, you've only gotten here. You need to build your strength and worth.
NOTE: this command will be useful later, but you aren't ready to use it, yet. You can track commands like this by typing THINK, which will also clue you if they now work.

@hfull
#testcase-values-from-number-of-white-wave-is-2754
>ll
You scan the area. This will suffice most of the time, though you may wish to LL a thing that doesn't jibe with its rhymes.
You notice one dot in the corner.
The leet learner's display lights up and scrolls through LCD numbers which settle on the pair (-1.00, 0.00.)
\\
#testcase-values-from-number-of-player-is--5610
>ll me
You notice one dot in the corner.
The leet learner's display lights up and scrolls through LCD numbers which settle on the pair (-1.00, -1.00.)
However, it's really dim, as if you don't need to do or think whatever there is to do or think.

@mis
#testcase-mistakes-table-of-general-good-guesses-flight-flav-flave
>flight flave
You try a bit of trickery. Can you fly? No, you cannot. You can play small mind games, but you can't violate the laws of physics.
[NOTE: to switch on the option that shows how many similar rhyme pairs you have left in this area, you can type GO GUESS. To see more detailed guess information with THINK, type MO MESS. To be told if you have one word of a good non-point-scoring good guess, YO YES. These all also incorporate the LO LESS option, where the leet learner tells you how many rhymes are left to solve. NO NESS turns everything.]
\\
#+testcase-mistakes-table-of-general-good-guesses-flight-flav-flave
>flight flav
You try a bit of trickery. Can you fly? No, you cannot. You can play small mind games, but you can't violate the laws of physics.

@goto
>u
Apropos of nothing, you mumble to yourself "Flight flav ... flight flav ..." You jump. Oddly, you jump higher than you ever have before. But not enough. That must work, though, for a way out.

>kite cave
by one point

@all,rej
{--rej}#testcase-check-vc-kite-cave-rule-fallthrough
{--all}#testcase-run-vr-kite-cave-rule-default
You look around, and what do you know? You see part of a kite stuck under a rock, in a cave. You try to move the rock, and when you do, you hear a rumbling. You try to take the kite, but it's tied to a string and is sucked down the hole and around a corner. The hole itself collapses, becoming big enough to climb down.
The cave collapses. There's a passage DOWN, but next to it is a hold-hole. Perhaps looking at it will give you some clues what to do with your journey.

You're liberal and lenient and all that, but some things cross the line. It's something you didn't want to see, and something that's awkward to deal with, but you find the offender and suggest they move on. If they aren't physically hurting anyone, they are, and will be, in others' personal space. There's no need for lectures. You nod your head pointedly. They understand, or seem to. Perhaps they will just move on elsewhere, but maybe if enough people speak up, they'll get the big message.

There's a sour slate lying around, which you don't want to touch in its current form.

The verbal and mental flak that clung to you? Some of it peels off. It feels good.
You feel good about doing more than the bare minimum to repel your fears. It's something you always feared, because what if you do more than the bare minimum, and your fears catch up to you anyway? That'd be depressing. Maybe it will happen. But since you've beaten your fears back a bit further, it will take longer than if you do more than the bare minimum, feel fear, and feel silly for not doing more to repel fears in the future. So that's something.

Congratulations. You are now one proud owner of an oversized, overwrought motivational book. Well, it's thick enough to replace the shield you lost.

Shortly, someone who must be Failing Phil drops by. "You don't know Tully, do you? You're not with Tully?" You reassure Failing Phil otherwise, even addressing some of your own beefs with Tully. You chat a while. He mentions how Tully kept asking him to do more impossible things, or how Tully pointed out inane imperfections that made it harder for him to do simple things right for a while. He's better now. Then he sees the cold coal and asks you if he may touch it. Both seem to glow as a result. He thanks you.

You chat a while. He mentions how he used to be cheerful, but Tully somehow found simple ways to get under his skin. He knew he complained too much, and he could have stopped complaining if he really tried. He sees the sold soul and apologizes: "I'm sure you have it even worse." The sold soul nods. Perhaps. But that doesn't matter. It's not about comparisons. An enlightening conversation follows, and you are all the better for it. Wailing Will waves and walks away.

You chat a while. He expresses guilt over fleeing, not just when Tully mocked him, but his friends, and he could have said something but didn't. He touches the bold bowl, which vibrates in his hands. "I have more to say now, when I need to." Then he thanks you and walks away.

Yes, indeed, it isn't just about being trite or having irony.
Trite Tully looks shocked! "No! No! It can't be!" Suddenly, they look much more humble.
"Once ... once, they called me a name. Sham, shy! I feel that way again... it's not fair. I deserved so much more! And I had it!"
You wonder what to do. Tully looks pleadingly at you, but you still detect contempt. You think.

You dither between showing too much mercy and too little. Then you think. Tully's had their fun. You wonder if you can just dismiss people like that. Are you really that unsocial? Or antisocial?
Of course not. You've brought three pairs of friends together. And at the end, you brought relief to three people Tully insulted. They've caused enough annoyance. It's time to go. You don't even have to mention Tully's silly mind games that brought you here.

You could have tried to WRITE/RIGHT RAVE to flatter me.
You could have noted a pattern with the regions in the status line and tried EYEING EASE.
You could have been a bright knave and said R 3 once you'd paired two groups of friends, whether you knew their names or not.
You didn't guess the the bold bowl, the sold soul and the cold coal before finding them.
You could have told a NUDE NAPPER to be more modest in the Crude Crapper.
You could've said FLOUT FLUFF in Out, Uff!.
You could've said FLAK FLIGHT in Sack Site.
You could've said GRANDER GROVE in Dander, Dove.
You didn't enter MIME MODE in Passed Port.
You didn't take a moment to remember PAUL PANKS in Tall Tank(s).
You didn't find the PLEAD PLAQUE in Treed Track.
You could have tried to JACK GIST for a shorter command to read the track tryst lack list.
