}$REJECT=I couldn't parse that command. You don't need any more than two words long.
}$REJECT1=Most special commands are more than one word. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT1A=Most special commands are more than one word, because of the rhyme-pairs involved. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Civil Seeming Drivel Dreaming has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$GREENBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$GREENCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green--one of the words you thought must be right.
}$GREENCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green.
}$YELLOWBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$YELLOWCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow--one of the words must work for a future solution.
}$YELLOWCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow.

>bold bowl
Yes. The bold bowl must be one of the three entities that fit in the hold hole. This is good to know.
[NOTE: you've figured one-third of the sacred items of your quest. You can guess them all for a bonus point, or you can get on with it. Knowing what you look for is not critical to finding it.]
[NOTE: to switch on the option that shows how many similar rhyme pairs you have left in this area, you can type GO GUESS. To see more detailed guess information with THINK, type MO MESS. To be told if you have one word of a good non-point-scoring good guess, YO YES. These all also incorporate the LO LESS option, where the leet learner tells you how many rhymes are left to solve. NO NESS turns everything.]
